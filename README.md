Modern embedded systems programming starts with the hardware and extends all the way to the cloud. The resulting myriad of programming languages, libraries, tools, data structures, and algorithms may seem difficult for any one programmer to master. In this course, we introduce the fundamentals of programming languages and software engineering common to all levels of embedded systems programming, giving students the conceptual tools they need to tackle any project.

Specifically, this course takes a detailed look at two programming languages, C++ and Javascript; teaches students how to use build tools, version control, and advanced editors; describes how to use and create software libraries; and ties everything together with a collaborative software engineering project.

**Lectures**: Thurs 6pm - 9pm
**Homework**: Due ~ Wednesdays @ 11:59pm

## Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly, and will be due the following Wednesday. Homework will be submitted by pushing your code and other materials to a github repository. We will clone your code and attempt to run it and grade it base on functionality, completeness, and style.

Detailed assignments are listed on the [wiki](https://github.com/klavinslab/ee590/wiki).

## Resources

* We will be using Github for version controlling all of our code. Make a user name and get the [Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) so you can use various resources for free.
* Please use the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io) to edit your code.
